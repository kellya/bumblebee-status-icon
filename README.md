# Bumblebee status icon

Trying my hand at completing https://github.com/tobi-wan-kenobi/bumblebee-status/issues/639

# sample

# concept

The wings are an infinity symbol, showing the infinite possibilities of themes
and plugin modules for bumblebee status.

The abdomen is an alternating chevron pattern, inspired by the powerline themes.

And then, there is a stinger and a head.  Because, um,  it's a bee, and bees have
those things :)

# img dir

There are two files in the img dir.  The first one (bumblebee_status.svg) is the logo pointing straight
up and down.  The second one (bumblebee_status_rt.svg) is at a 30 degree angle.  The 30 degree
angle variant is what I intended as the logo, but it's easier to space things
when it is straight up and down and then rotate it as an export.
