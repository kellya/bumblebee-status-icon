# Bumblebee-status icon

Trying my hand at completing https://github.com/tobi-wan-kenobi/bumblebee-status/issues/639

# sample

# concept

The wings are an infinity symbol, showing the infinite possibilities of themes
and plugin modules for bumblebee-status.

The abdomen is an alternating chevron pattern, inspired by the powerline themes
section separation character.

And then, there is a stinger and a head.  Because, um,  it's a bee, and bees have
those things :)

# img dir

There are two files in the img dir.  The first one (bumblebee_status.svg) is
the logo pointing straight up and down.  The second one (bumblebee_status_rtl.svg)
is at a 30 degree angle.  The 30 degree angle variant is what is intended as the
logo, but it's easier to space things when it is straight up and down and then
rotate it as an export.

## Why is the file named bumblebee_status_rtl?
The initial version was drawn straight up and down (bumblebee_status.svg).  The
logo was then rotated 30 degrees clockwise and named "bumblebee_status_rt"
(rt being short for rotated). Then, a second version was created where the logo
was rotated the other way (to the [l]eft), and was named "bumblebee_status_rtl.svg".
